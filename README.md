# Lightbar
This arduino project uses 4 RGB LED strips to create a police lighbar effect.
It can be controlled with buttons hooked up to the arduino or with the serial monitor in the arduino IDE.
To control it with serial the baud rate is 115200 and it takes two number(front and back) separated by a ':'
Ex. 3:1 would set the front to pattern 3 and the back to pattern 1.
The patterns are described at the top of the main file.
